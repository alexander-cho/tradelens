Create a Q4 object for me
SourcedFrom can be "10-K"
For most metrics it will be FY-(Q1+Q2+Q3), and few point in time metrics if any will just be the FY value
For EPS: [Basic, Diluted], please make objects for it as usual EXCEPT leave the "Value": ___ just blank so there's an error,
I'll have to manually do that one or something
